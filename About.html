                    <h2 id="bio-heading">Who I Am</h2>
                    <p>
                        I'm Kayode Anointed, a full-stack developer with a passion for building accessible and 
                        user-friendly web applications. My journey into tech started from a curiosity about how 
                        things work on the internet, and it's grown into a genuine love for problem-solving through code.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Beyond coding, I find joy in photography, outdoor adventures, and playing acoustic guitar. 
                        These hobbies help me maintain balance and bring fresh perspectives to my work. I believe 
                        the best solutions come when we step away from the screen and let our minds wander.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm a strong advocate for clean code, good documentation, and building products that 
                        everyone can use regardless of their abilities. Accessibility isn't just a requirement 
                        for me; it's a fundamental principle that guides how I approach every project.

                    <h2 id="goals-heading">My Goals in This Program</h2>
                    <p>
                        Joining this program is a deliberate step towards leveling up my skills and connecting 
                        with like-minded developers. Here's what I'm aiming to achieve:
                    </p>
                    <h3>Technical Growth</h3>
                    <p>
                        I want to deepen my understanding of modern web development patterns and best practices. 
                        While I'm comfortable with the basics, there's always more to learn about performance 
                        optimization, advanced CSS techniques, and architectural patterns that scale.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Real-World Experience</h3>
                    <p>
                        Working on projects that mirror real industry challenges is invaluable. I'm here to build 
                        things that matter, get feedback from experienced developers, and learn how to navigate 
                        the complexity of production-ready applications.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Community and Collaboration</h3>
                    <p>
                        One of my biggest goals is to become better at working in teams, giving and receiving 
                        code reviews, and contributing to open source. I believe the best learning happens when 
                        we learn together and support each other's growth.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </section>

            <!-- Confidence Section -->
            <section class="about-section" data-testid="test-about-confidence" aria-labelledby="confidence-heading">
                <div class="section-icon" aria-hidden="true">ðŸŒ±</div>
                <div class="section-content">
                    <h2 id="confidence-heading">Areas Where I'm Building Confidence</h2>
                    <p>
                        Growth requires honesty about where we need improvement. Here are the areas I'm actively 
                        working to strengthen:
                    </p>
                    <h3>Testing and Test-Driven Development</h3>
                    <p>
                        While I understand the importance of testing, writing comprehensive test suites doesn't 
                        come naturally to me yet. I often focus on getting features working first and testing 
                        later, which I know isn't ideal. I'm working on making testing a first-class part of 
                        my development process.
                    </p>
                    <h3>System Design and Architecture</h3>
                    <p>
                        I can build features and components well, but thinking about large-scale architecture 
                        and how all the pieces fit together is still challenging. Questions about database 
                        design, caching strategies, and microservices architecture make me pause and doubt 
                        my decisions.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Speaking Up in Technical Discussions</h3>
                    <p>
                        I sometimes hold back in code reviews or technical discussions, worried that my ideas 
                        might not be good enough or that I'll say something wrong. I'm learning that every 
                        perspective adds value and that asking questions is a sign of engagement, not weakness.
                    </p>

            <!-- Future Note Section -->
            <section class="about-section" data-testid="test-about-future-note" aria-labelledby="future-heading">
                <div class="section-icon" aria-hidden="true">ðŸ’Œ</div>

                    <h2 id="future-heading">A Note to My Future Self</h2>
                    <div class="future-note">
                        <p>Hey future me,</p>
                        <p>
                            I hope when you're reading this, you're looking back with a smile at how far you've come. 
                            Remember when you weren't sure if you could finish this program? Remember the late nights 
                            debugging code that seemed impossible to fix?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I want you to know that right now, in this moment, you're doing your best. You're showing 
                            up, putting in the work, and pushing through the discomfort of not knowing everything. 
                            That's what matters.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Don't forget why you started this journey. It wasn't just about getting a job or learning 
                            to code. It was about proving to yourself that you can learn hard things, that you can 
                            grow beyond what you thought possible.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Keep that curiosity alive. Keep asking questions. Keep building things, even when they 
                            break. And most importantly, keep helping others along the way. The community that lifts 
                            you up deserves your contribution too.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You've got this. You always did.
                        </p>

                    <h3>On Imposter Syndrome</h3>
                    <p>
                        I've realized that feeling like an imposter never really goes away; you just get better 
                        at recognizing it for what it is. Every developer, no matter how experienced, has moments 
                        of doubt. The difference is that experienced developers have learned to push through 
                        anyway.
                    </p>
                    <h3>What Success Looks Like to Me</h3>
                    <p>
                        Success isn't about becoming the best developer in the room. It's about becoming someone 
                        who can solve problems, work well with others, and build things that make people's lives 
                        better. It's about being reliable, curious, and kind.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Looking Forward</h3>
                    <p>
                        I'm excited about what's ahead. This program is just the beginning of a much longer 
                        journey, and I'm here for all of itâ€”the challenges, the victories, the late-night 
                        breakthroughs, and the community we're building together.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Let's do this.
